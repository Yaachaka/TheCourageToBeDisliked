HEADER3: Not Self-Affirmation-- Self-Acceptance
PHILOSOPHER: First of all, let's look at what you were just saying, about your selfconsciousness putting the brakes on and not letting you behave in an innocent way. There are probably many people who experience this trouble. So let's go back to the source again and think about your goal. What could you be trying to gain by putting the brakes on your own innocent behavior?
YOUTH: It's the genuine desire to not be laughed at, to not be thought of as a fool.
PHILOSOPHER: So in other words, you do not have confidence in your innocent self, in yourself just as you are, right? And you stay away from the kind of interpersonal relationship in which you would just be yourself. But I'll bet that when you're home alone, you sing out loud and dance to music and speak in a lively voice.
YOUTH: Ha-ha! It's almost like you've set up a surveillance camera in my room! But yes, it's true. I can behave freely when I'm alone.
PHILOSOPHER: Anyone can behave like a king when they're alone. So this is an issue that should be considered in the context of interpersonal relations. Because it isn't that you don't have an innocent self--it is only that you can't do such things in front of others.
YOUTH: Well, what should I do then?
PHILOSOPHER: It's about community feeling, after all. Concretely speaking, it's making the switch from <i>attachment to self</i> (self-interest) to <i>concern for others</i> (social interest) and gaining a sense of community feeling. Three things are needed at this point: "selfacceptance," "confidence in others," and "contribution to others."
YOUTH: Interesting. New keywords, I see. What do they refer to?
PHILOSOPHER: Let's start with self-acceptance. On our first night, I brought up that statement of Adler's: "The important thing is not what one is born with but what use one makes of that equipment." Do you remember this?
YOUTH: Yes, of course.
PHILOSOPHER: We cannot discard the receptacle that is the "I," and neither can we replace it. The important thing, however, is "what use one makes of that equipment." One changes one's way of looking at the "I"--that is to say, one changes how one uses it.
YOUTH: Does that mean be more positive and have a stronger sense of self-affirmation? Think about everything more positively?
PHILOSOPHER: There is no need to go out of one's way to be positive and affirm oneself. It's not self-affirmation that we are concerned with, but self-acceptance.
YOUTH: Not self-affirmation, but self-acceptance?
PHILOSOPHER: That's right. There is a clear difference. Self-affirmation is making suggestions to oneself, such as "I can do it" or "I am strong," even when something is simply beyond one's ability. It is a notion that can bring about a superiority complex, and may even be termed a way of living in which one lies to oneself. With self-acceptance, on the other hand, if one cannot do something, one is simply accepting "one's incapable self" as is and moving forward so that one can do whatever one can. It is not a way of lying to oneself. To put it more simply, say you've got a score of 60 percent, but you tell yourself, I just happened to get unlucky this time around, and the real me is 100 percent. That is self-affirmation. By contrast, if one accepts oneself as one is, as 60 percent, and thinks to oneself, How should I go about getting closer to 100 percent?--that is self-acceptance.
YOUTH: So even if you're only 60 percent, there's no need to be pessimistic?
PHILOSOPHER: Of course not. No one is perfect. Do you recall what I said when I was explaining the pursuit of superiority? That all people are in this condition of wanting to improve? Put the other way around, there is no such thing as a 100 percent person. This is something we should actively acknowledge.
YOUTH: Hmm. What you are saying sounds positive in various respects, but it has a negative ring to it as well.
PHILOSOPHER: Here I use the term "affirmative resignation."
YOUTH: Affirmative resignation?
PHILOSOPHER: This is also the case with the separation of tasks--one ascertains the things one can change and the things one cannot change. One cannot change what one is born with. But one can, under one's own power, go about changing what use one makes of that equipment. So in that case, one simply has to focus on what one can change, rather than on what one cannot. This is what I call self-acceptance.
YOUTH: What one can change, and what one cannot.
PHILOSOPHER: That's right. Accept what is irreplaceable. Accept "this me" just as it is. And have the courage to change what one can change. That is self-acceptance.
YOUTH: Hmm. That reminds me of a line that the writer Kurt Vonnegut quoted in one of his books: "God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change; courage to change the things I can; and wisdom to know the difference." It's in the novel Slaughterhouse-Five.
PHILOSOPHER: Yes, I know it. It is the Serenity Prayer. These words are well known and have been transmitted for many years in Christian societies.
YOUTH: He even used the word "courage." I read the book so intently I should know it by heart. But I never noticed this point until now.
PHILOSOPHER: It's true. We do not lack ability. We just lack courage. It all comes down to courage.
