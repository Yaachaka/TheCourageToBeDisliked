HEADER3: Life Is a Series of Moments
PHILOSOPHER: All right. When you speak of lofty goals, I am guessing that you have an image of something like a mountain climber aiming for the top.
YOUTH: Yes, that's right. People, myself included, aim for the top of the mountain.
PHILOSOPHER: But if life were climbing a mountain in order to reach the top, then the greater part of life would end up being "en route." That is to say, one's "real life" would begin with one's trek on the mountainside, and the distance one has traveled up until that point would be a "tentative life" led by a "tentative me."
YOUTH: I guess that's one way of putting it. The way I am now, I am definitely an "en route" person.
PHILOSOPHER: Now, suppose you didn't make it to the mountaintop, what would that mean for your life? With accidents and diseases and the like, people don't always make it all the way, and mountain climbing itself is fraught with pitfalls and often ends in failure. So one's life would be interrupted "en route," with just this "tentative me" leading a "tentative life." What kind of life would that be?
YOUTH: That's . . . Well, that'd be a case of getting one's just deserts. So I didn't have the ability, or I didn't have the physical strength to climb a mountain, or I wasn't lucky, or I lacked the skill--that's all! Yes, that is a reality I am prepared to accept.
PHILOSOPHER: Adlerian psychology has a different standpoint. People who think of life as being like climbing a mountain are treating their own existences as lines. As if there is a line that started the instant one came into this world, and that continues in all manner of curves of varying sizes until it arrives at the summit, and then at long last reaches its terminus, which is death. This conception, which treats life as a kind of story, is an idea that links with Freudian etiology (the attributing of causes), and is a way of thinking that makes the greater part of life into something that is "en route."
YOUTH: Well, what is your image of life?
PHILOSOPHER: Do not treat it as a line. Think of life as a series of dots. If you look through a magnifying glass at a solid line drawn with chalk, you will discover that what you thought was a line is actually a series of small dots. Seemingly linear existence is actually a series of dots; in other words, life is a series of moments.
YOUTH: A series of moments?
PHILOSOPHER: Yes. It is a series of moments called "now." We can live only in the here and now. Our lives exist only in moments. Adults who do not know this attempt to impose "linear" lives onto young people. Their thinking is that staying on the conventional tracks--good university, big company, stable household--is a happy life. But life is not made up of lines or anything like that.
YOUTH: So there's no need for life planning or career planning?
PHILOSOPHER: If life were a line, then life planning would be possible. But our lives are only a series of dots. A well-planned life is not something to be treated as necessary or unnecessary, as it is impossible.
YOUTH: Oh, nonsense! What an absurd idea!
