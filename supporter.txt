HEADER3: You Are Not the Center of the World
PHILOSOPHER: Let's go over things in order. First of all, each of us is a member of a community, and that is where we belong. Feeling that one has one's own place of refuge within the community, feeling that "it's okay to be here," and having a sense of belonging--these are basic human desires. Whether it is one's studies, work, or friendships, or one's love or marriage, all these things are connected to one's search for places and relationships in which one can feel "it's okay to be here." Wouldn't you agree?
YOUTH: Ah, yes, I do! That's it exactly!
PHILOSOPHER: And the protagonist in one's life is the "I." There is nothing wrong with the train of thought up to this point. But the "I" does not rule the center of the world. While the "I" is life's protagonist, it is never more than a member of the community and a part of the whole.
YOUTH: A part of the whole?
PHILOSOPHER: People who have concern only for themselves think that they are at the center of the world. To such people, others are merely "people who will do something for me." They half genuinely believe that everyone else exists to serve them and should give precedence to their feelings.
YOUTH: Just like a prince or a princess.
PHILOSOPHER: Yes, exactly. They make a leap from being "life's protagonist" to becoming "the world's protagonist." For this reason, whenever they come into contact with another person, all they can think is, What will this person give me? However--and this is something that does not hold true for princes and princesses--this expectation is not going to be satisfied on every occasion. Because other people are not living to satisfy your expectations.
YOUTH: Indeed.
PHILOSOPHER: Then, when those expectations are not satisfied, they become deeply disillusioned and feel as if they have been horribly insulted. And they become resentful, and think, That person didn't do anything for me. That person let me down. That person isn't my comrade anymore. He's my enemy. People who hold the belief that they are the center of the world always end up losing their comrades before long.
YOUTH: That's strange. Didn't you say that we are living in a subjective world? As long as the world is a subjective space, I am the only one who can be at its center. I won't let anyone else be there.
PHILOSOPHER: I think that when you speak of "the world," what you have in mind is something like a map of the world.
YOUTH: A map of the world? What are you talking about?
PHILOSOPHER: For example, on the map of the world used in France, the Americas are located on the left side, and Asia is on the right. Europe and France are depicted at the center of the map, of course. The map of the world used in China, on the other hand, shows the Americas on the right side and Europe on the left. French people who see the Chinese map of the world will most likely experience a difficult-to-describe sense of incongruity, as if they have been driven unjustly to the fringes, or cut out of the world arbitrarily.
YOUTH: Yes, I see your point.
PHILOSOPHER: But what happens when a globe is used to represent the world? Because with a globe, you can look at the world with France at the center, or China, or Brazil, for that matter. Every place is central, and no place is, at the same time. The globe may be dotted with an infinite number of centers, in accordance with the viewer's location and angle of view. That is the nature of a globe.
YOUTH: Hmm, that is true.
PHILOSOPHER: Think of what I said earlier--that you are not the center of the world--as being the same thing. You are a part of a community, not its center.
YOUTH: I am not the center of the world. Our world is a globe, not a map that has been cut out on a plane. Well, I can understand that in theory, anyway. But why do I have to be aware of the fact that I'm not the center of the world?
PHILOSOPHER: Now we will go back to where we started. All of us are searching for the sense of belonging, that "it's okay to be here." In Adlerian psychology, however, a sense of belonging is something that one can attain only by making an active commitment to the community of one's own accord, and not simply by being here.
YOUTH: By making an active commitment? What does one do, exactly?
PHILOSOPHER: One faces one's life tasks. In other words, one takes steps forward on one's own, without avoiding the tasks of the interpersonal relations of work, friendship, and love. If you are "the center of the world," you will have no thoughts whatsoever regarding commitment to the community; because everyone else is "someone who will do something for me," and there is no need for you to do things yourself. But you are not the center of the world, and neither am I. One has to stand on one's own two feet, and take one's own steps forward with the tasks of interpersonal relations. One needs to think not, What will this person give me? but rather, What can I give to this person? That is commitment to the community.
YOUTH: It is because one gives something that one can find one's refuge?
PHILOSOPHER: That's right. A sense of belonging is something that one acquires through one's own efforts--it is not something one is endowed with at birth. Community feeling is the much-debated key concept of Adlerian psychology.
NARRATOR: It was certainly a concept that the young man found difficult to accept at first. And naturally, it upset him to be told he was self-centered. But what he found hardest to accept was the incredible extent of that community, which included the universe and inanimate objects. What were Adler and this philosopher talking about, anyway? With a bewildered expression, the young man slowly opened his mouth to speak.
