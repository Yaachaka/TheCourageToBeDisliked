HEADER3: Exist in the Present
PHILOSOPHER: Well, have you worked things out?
YOUTH: Gradually, but yes, it's getting clearer. You don't seem to be aware of it, but just now you said something really over the top. It's a dangerous, rather extreme opinion that just negates everything in the world.
PHILOSOPHER: Oh, really? What is it?
YOUTH: It's the idea that being of use to someone is what gives one a true awareness of one's worth. If you put it the other way around, a person who isn't of any use to others has no worth at all. That's what you are saying, isn't it? If one takes that to its logical conclusion, then the lives of newborn babies and of invalids and old people who are bedridden aren't worth living either. How could this be? Let's talk about my grandfather. He spends his days bedridden at an old people's home. Since he has dementia, he doesn't recognize any of his children or grandchildren, and his condition is such that he would not be able to go on living without constant care. One simply couldn't think of him as being of use to someone. Don't you see? Your opinion is basically the same thing as saying to my grandfather, "People like you aren't qualified to live!"
PHILOSOPHER: I reject that definitively.
YOUTH: How do you reject that?
PHILOSOPHER: There are parents who refute my explanation of the concept of encouragement by saying, "Our child does bad things from morning to night, and there is never an occasion to tell him, 'Thank you,' or 'You helped a lot.' " The context is probably the same as what you are talking about, isn't it?
YOUTH: Yes, it is. So tell me please how you justify that.
PHILOSOPHER: At this point, you are looking at another person on the level of his acts. In other words, that that person "did something." So from that point of view, it might seem that bedridden old people are only a nuisance and are of no use to anyone. So let's look at other people not on the "level of acts" but on the "level of being." Without judging whether or not other people did something, one rejoices in their being there, in their very existence, and one calls out to them with words of gratitude.
YOUTH: You call out to their existence? What on earth are you talking about?
PHILOSOPHER: If you consider things at the level of being, we are of use to others and have worth just by being here. This is an indisputable fact.
YOUTH: No way! Enough joking around. Being of use to someone just by being here--that's got to be straight out of some new religion.
PHILOSOPHER: Well, for example, suppose your mother has a car accident. Her condition is serious, and her life may be in danger. At a time like that, you would not be wondering if your mother "did something," or anything of the sort. More than likely, you will just be thinking you'll be glad if she makes it, and you're glad she is holding on right now.
YOUTH: Of course I would!
PHILOSOPHER: That's what it means to be grateful on the level of being. Your mother might not be able to do anything in her critical condition that would be considered an act, but just by being alive, she would be supporting the psychological state of you and your family, and would therefore be of use. The same could be said for you, too. If your life were in danger, and you were hanging on by a thread, the people around you would probably feel very gladdened just by the very fact of your existing. They would simply feel thankful that you are safe in the here and now, and would not be wanting you to perform some direct act. At the very least, there is no reason they would have to think that way. So instead of thinking of oneself on the level of acts, first of all one accepts oneself on the level of being.
YOUTH: That's an extreme example--everyday life is different.
PHILOSOPHER: No, it is the same.
YOUTH: What is the same about it? Try and give me a more everyday example, please. If you can't, I won't be able to agree with this.
PHILOSOPHER: All right. When we look at other people, we are prone to construct our own ideal images of ourselves, which we then detract from and judge. Imagine, for example, a child who never talks back to his parents, excels in both schoolwork and sports, attends a good university, and joins a large company. There are parents who will compare their child to such an image of an ideal child--which is an impossible fiction--and then be filled with complaints and dissatisfaction. They treat the idealized image as one hundred points, and they gradually subtract from that. This is truly a "judgment" way of thinking. Instead, the parents could refrain from comparing their child to anyone else, see him for who he actually is, and be glad and grateful for his being there. Instead of taking away points from some idealized image, they could start from zero. And if they do that, they should be able to call out to his existence itself.
YOUTH: Okay, but I'd say that's just an idealistic approach. So are you saying that even with the kind of child who never goes to school or gets a job, but just shuts himself in and stays home, one should still communicate one's gratitude and say thank you?
PHILOSOPHER: Of course. Suppose your shut-in child helped you wash the dishes after a meal. If you were to say then, "Enough of that already--just go to school," you would be using the words of such parents who detract from an image of an ideal child. If you were to take such an approach, the child would probably end up even more discouraged. However, if you can say a straightforward thank you, the child just might feel his own worth and take a new step forward.
YOUTH: That's just utterly hypocritical! It's nothing more than the nonsensical talk of a hypocrite. It sounds like the "neighborly love" that Christians talk about. The community feeling, the horizontal relationships, the gratitude for existence, and so on. Who on earth could actually do such things?
PHILOSOPHER: With regard to this issue of community feeling, there was a person who asked Adler a similar question. Adler's reply was the following: "Someone has to start. Other people might not be cooperative, but that is not connected to you. My advice is this: you should start. With no regard to whether others are cooperative or not." My advice is exactly the same.
