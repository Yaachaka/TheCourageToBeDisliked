HEADER2: THE FOURTH NIGHT: Where the Center of the World Is
NARRATOR: <i>That was close--I almost fell for it!</i> The following week, the young man called on the philosopher again, and, with an indignant expression, knocked on the door.<br/><i>The idea of separating tasks is certainly a useful one. You had me completely convinced last time. But it seems like such a lonely way to live. Separating the tasks and lightening the load of one's interpersonal relations is just the same as cutting one's connection to other people. And, to top it off, you're telling me to be disliked by other people? If that's what you call freedom, then I'll choose not to be free!</i>
HEADER3: Individual Psychology and Holism
PHILOSOPHER: Well, you're looking rather gloomy today.
YOUTH: You see, since we last met, I've been thinking calmly and carefully about the separation of tasks, and about freedom. I waited until my emotions had settled and then applied my reasoning mind. But the separation of tasks just doesn't seem realistic.
PHILOSOPHER: Hmm, okay. Please go on.
YOUTH: Separating tasks is basically an idea that boils down to defining a boundary and saying, "I am I, and you are you." Sure, there are probably fewer interpersonal relationship problems that way. But would you really say that such a way of life is right? To me, it just seems like an extremely self-centered, misguided individualism. On my first visit here, you told me that Adlerian psychology is formally referred to as "individual psychology." That term had been bothering me for quite a while, but I finally figured out why: What you're calling Adlerian psychology, or individual psychology, is essentially the study of an individualism that leads people into isolation.
PHILOSOPHER: It is true that the term "individual psychology," which Adler coined, has certain aspects that may invite misunderstanding. I will explain what I mean now. First of all, etymologically speaking, the word "individual" has the meaning "indivisible."
YOUTH: Indivisible?
PHILOSOPHER: Yes. In other words, it is the smallest possible unit and therefore cannot be broken down any further. Now, what is it exactly that cannot be divided? Adler was opposed to any kind of dualistic value system that treated the mind as separate from the body--reason as separate from emotion, or the conscious mind as separate from the unconscious mind.
YOUTH: What's the point of that?
PHILOSOPHER: For example, do you remember the story about the female student who came to me for counseling on account of her fear of blushing? Why did she develop that fear of blushing? In Adlerian psychology, physical symptoms are not regarded separately from the mind (psyche). The mind and body are viewed as one, as a whole that cannot be divided into parts. Tension in the mind can make one's arms and legs shake, or cause one's cheeks to turn red, and fear can make one's face turn white. And so on.
YOUTH: Well, sure, there are parts of the mind and body that are connected.
PHILOSOPHER: The same holds true for reason and emotion, and the conscious mind and the unconscious mind as well. A normally coolheaded person doesn't expect to have a fit of violent emotion and start shouting at someone. We are not struck by emotions that somehow exist independently from us. Each of us is a unified whole.
YOUTH: No, that is not true. It is precisely because we have the ability to view mind and body, reason and emotion, and the conscious and the unconscious mind as clearly separate from each other that we can gain a correct understanding of people. Isn't that a given?
PHILOSOPHER: Certainly it is true that the mind and the body are separate things, that reason and emotion are different, and that both the conscious mind and the unconscious mind exist. That said, however, when one flies into a rage and shouts at another person, it is "I as a whole" who is choosing to shout. One would never think of emotions that somehow exist independently--unrelated to one's intentions, as it were--as having produced that shouting voice. When one separates the "I" from "emotion" and thinks, It was the emotion that made me do it, or The emotion got the best of me, and I couldn't help it, such thinking quickly becomes a life-lie.
YOUTH: You're referring to the time I yelled at that waiter, aren't you?
PHILOSOPHER: Yes. This view of the human being as "I as a whole," as an indivisible being that cannot be broken down into parts, is referred to as "holism."
YOUTH: Well, that's fine. But I wasn't asking you for an academic theory to provide a definition of "individual." Look, if you take Adlerian psychology to its logical conclusion, it's basically saying, "I am I, and you are you," and leading people toward isolation. It's saying, "I won't interfere with you, so don't interfere with me either, and we'll both go on living however we please." Please tell me straightforwardly what your awareness is of that point.
PHILOSOPHER: All right. All problems are interpersonal relationship problems. You have an understanding of this basic tenet of Adlerian psychology, correct?
YOUTH: Yes, I do. The idea of noninterference in interpersonal relations, that is to say, the separation of tasks, probably came about as a way to resolve those problems.
PHILOSOPHER: This is something I believe I went over last time--that forming good interpersonal relationships requires a certain degree of distance. At the same time, people who get too close end up not even being able to speak to each other, so it is not good to get too far apart, either. Please do not think of the separation of tasks as something that is meant to keep other people away; instead, see it as a way of thinking with which to unravel the threads of the complex entanglement of one's interpersonal relations.
YOUTH: To unravel the threads?
PHILOSOPHER: Exactly. Right now, your threads and other people's threads are all tangled up in a confused mess, and you are looking at the world while in that condition. Red, blue, brown, and green--all the colors mixing together--you think of it as "connection." But it is not.
YOUTH: So, then, what do you think connection is?
PHILOSOPHER: Last time, I spoke of the separation of tasks as a prescription for resolving interpersonal relationship problems. But interpersonal relationships are not something that end just because one has separated the tasks. The separating of tasks is actually the point of departure for interpersonal relations. Today, let's take the discussion deeper and address how interpersonal relations as a whole are viewed in Adlerian psychology, and consider the kind of relationships we should form with others.
