HEADER3: Young People Walk Ahead of Adults
YOUTH: I will acknowledge that work has aspects of contribution to others. But the logic that says that officially one is contributing to others when, in actuality, one is doing it for oneself, is nothing other than hypocrisy. How do you explain that?
PHILOSOPHER: Imagine the following kind of scene. It's after dinner at home, and there are still dishes left on the table. The children have gone off to their rooms, and the husband is sitting on the sofa watching television. It's been left to the wife (me) to do the dishes and clear everything up. To make matters worse, the family takes that for granted, and they don't make the slightest effort to help. In such a situation, normally one would think, Why won't they give me a hand? or Why do I have to do all the work? Even if I do not hear the words "thank you" from my family while I am cleaning up, I want them to think that I am of use to the family. Instead of thinking about what others can do for me, I want to think about, and put into practice, what I can do for other people. Just by having that feeling of contribution, the reality right in front of me will take on a completely different hue. In fact, if I am grumbling to myself as I wash the dishes, I am probably not much fun to be around, so everyone just wants to keep their distance. On the other hand, if I'm humming away to myself and washing the dishes in good spirits, the children might come and give me a hand. At the very least, I'd be creating an atmosphere in which it is easier for them to offer their help.
YOUTH: Well, that might be the case in that setting, anyway.
PHILOSOPHER: Now, how come I have a feeling of contribution in that setting? I have it because I am able to think of the members of my family as comrades. If I cannot do that, inevitably there will be thoughts running through my head like, Why am I the only one doing this? and Why won't anyone give me a hand? Contribution that is carried out while one is seeing other people as enemies may indeed lead to hypocrisy. But if other people are one's comrades, that should never happen, regardless of the contributions one makes. You have been fixating on the word "hypocrisy" because you do not understand community feeling yet.
YOUTH: Okay . . .
PHILOSOPHER: For the sake of convenience, up to this point I have discussed self-acceptance, confidence in others, and contribution to others, in that order. However, these three are linked as an indispensable whole, in a sort of circular structure. It is because one accepts oneself just as one is--one self-accepts--that one can have "confidence in others" without the fear of being taken advantage of. And it is because one can place unconditional confidence in others, and feel that people are one's comrades, that one can engage in "contribution to others." Further, it is because one contributes to others that one can have the deep awareness that "I am of use to someone" and accept oneself just as one is. One can self-accept. The notes you took down the other day, do you have them with you?
YOUTH: Oh, you mean that note on the objectives put forward by Adlerian psychology? I've kept it on me ever since that day, of course. Here it is: "The two objectives for behavior: to be self-reliant and to live in harmony with society. The two objectives for the psychology that supports these behaviors: the consciousness that I have the ability and the consciousness that people are my comrades."
PHILOSOPHER: If you overlap the content of this note with what we have just been discussing, you should be able to gain a deeper understanding. In other words, "to be self-reliant" and "the consciousness that I have the ability" correspond to our discussion of self-acceptance. And then "to live in harmony with society" and "the consciousness that people are my comrades" connect to confidence in others and then to contribution to others.
YOUTH: I see. So the objective of life is community feeling. I think it will be some time before I can get this clear in my head, though.
PHILOSOPHER: Yes, it probably will. As Adler himself said, "Understanding a human being is no easy matter. Of all the forms of psychology, individual psychology is probably the most difficult to learn and put into practice."
YOUTH: That's exactly right! Even if the theories are convincing, it's hard to put them into practice.
PHILOSOPHER: It is even said that to truly understand Adlerian psychology and apply it to actually changing one's way of living, one needs "half the number of years one has lived." In other words, if you were to start studying it at the age of forty, it would take another twenty years, until you turned sixty. If you were to start studying at the age of twenty, it would take ten years, until you turned thirty. You are still young. Starting at such an early stage in life means that you might be able to change more quickly. In the sense that you can change quickly, you are walking ahead of the adults of the world. To go about changing yourself and making a new world, in a way you are ahead of me, too. It is okay to lose your way or lose focus. Do not be dependent on vertical relationships or be afraid of being disliked, and just make your way forward freely. If all the adults could see that young people were walking ahead of them, I am sure the world would change dramatically.
YOUTH: I am walking ahead of you?
PHILOSOPHER: You certainly are. We walk on the same ground, and you are moving on ahead of me.
YOUTH: Ha-ha. You're the first person I've ever met who would say such a thing to someone young enough to be his son.
PHILOSOPHER: I would like more and more young people to learn about Adler's thought. And I would like more adults to learn about it, too. Because people can change, regardless of their ages.
