HEADER3: How to Separate Tasks
PHILOSOPHER: Say there's a child who has a hard time studying. He doesn't pay attention in class, doesn't do his homework, and even leaves his books at school. Now, what would you do if you were his father?
YOUTH: Well, of course, I would try everything I could think of to get him to apply himself. I'd hire tutors and make him go to a study center, even if I had to pull him by the ear to get him there. I'd say that's a parent's duty. And that's actually how I was raised myself. I wasn't allowed to eat dinner until the day's homework was done.
PHILOSOPHER: Then let me ask another question. Did you learn to enjoy studying as a result of being made to do it in such a heavy-handed manner?
YOUTH: Unfortunately, I did not. I just took care of my studies for school and for exams in a routine way.
PHILOSOPHER: I see. All right, I will talk about this from the basic stance of Adlerian psychology. When one is confronted with the task of studying, for instance, in Adlerian psychology we consider it from the perspective of "Whose task is this?"
YOUTH: Whose task?
PHILOSOPHER: Whether the child studies or not. Whether he goes out and plays with his friends or not. Essentially this is the child's task, not the parent's task.
YOUTH: Do you mean that it is something the child is supposed to do?
PHILOSOPHER: Simply put, yes. There would be no point if the parents studied instead of the child, would there?
YOUTH: Well, no, there wouldn't.
PHILOSOPHER: Studying is the child's task. A parent's handling of that by commanding the child to study is, in effect, an act of intruding on another person's task. One is unlikely to avert a collision in this way. We need to think with the perspective of "Whose task is this?" and continually separate one's own tasks from other people's tasks.
YOUTH: How does one go about separating them?
PHILOSOPHER: One does not intrude on other people's tasks. That's all.
YOUTH: That's all?
PHILOSOPHER: In general, all interpersonal relationship troubles are caused by intruding on other people's tasks, or having one's own tasks intruded on. Carrying out the separation of tasks is enough to change one's interpersonal relationships dramatically.
YOUTH: Hmm. I don't really get it. In the first place, how can you tell whose task it is? From my point of view, realistically speaking, getting one's child to study is the duty of the parents. Because almost no child studies just out of enjoyment, and after all is said and done, the parent is the child's guardian.
PHILOSOPHER: There is a simple way to tell whose task it is. Think, Who ultimately is going to receive the result brought about by the choice that is made? When the child has made the choice of not studying, ultimately, the result of that decision--not being able to keep up in class or to get into the preferred school, for instance--does not have to be received by the parents. Clearly, it is the child who has to receive it. In other words, studying is the child's task.
YOUTH: No, no. You're completely wrong! The parent, who is more experienced in life and also acts as a guardian, has the responsibility to urge the child to study so such situations do not arise. This is something done for the good of the child and is not an act of intruding. While studying may be the child's task, getting the child to study is the parent's task.
PHILOSOPHER: It's true that one often hears parents today using the phrase "It's for your own good." But they are clearly doing so in order to fulfill their own goals, which could be their appearance in the eyes of society, their need to put on airs, or their desire for control, for example. In other words, it is not "for your own good" but for the parents'. And it is because the child senses this deception that he rebels.
YOUTH: So even if the child hasn't been studying at all, you're saying that, since it's his task, I should just let him be?
PHILOSOPHER: One has to pay attention. Adlerian psychology does not recommend the noninterference approach. Noninterference is the attitude of not knowing, and not even being interested in knowing what the child is doing. Instead, it is by knowing what the child is doing that one protects him. If it's studying that is the issue, one tells the child that that is his task, and one lets him know that one is ready to assist him whenever he has the urge to study. But one must not intrude on the child's task. When no requests are being made, it does not do to meddle in things.
YOUTH: Does this go beyond parent-child relationships?
PHILOSOPHER: Yes, of course. In Adlerian psychology counseling, for instance, we do not think of the client's changing or not changing as the task of the counselor.
YOUTH: What are you saying here?
PHILOSOPHER: As a result of having received counseling, what kind of resolution does the client make? To change his lifestyle, or not. This is the client's task, and the counselor cannot intervene.
YOUTH: No way, I can't accept such an irresponsible attitude!
PHILOSOPHER: Naturally, one gives all the assistance one possibly can. But beyond that, one doesn't intrude. Remember the old saying, "You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink." Please think of counseling and all other assistance provided to other people in Adlerian psychology as having that kind of stance. Forcing change while ignoring the person's intentions will only lead to an intense reaction.
YOUTH: The counselor does not change the client's life?
PHILOSOPHER: You are the only one who can change yourself.
