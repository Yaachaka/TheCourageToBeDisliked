HEADER3: Red String and Rigid Chains
YOUTH: Well, I'll save my objections for later. Next, what about the task of friendship?
PHILOSOPHER: This is a friend relationship in a broader sense, away from work, as there is none of the compulsion of the workplace. It is a relationship that is difficult to initiate or deepen.
YOUTH: Ah, you've got that right! If there's a space, like one's school or workplace, one can still build a relationship. But then it would be a superficial relationship that is limited to that space. To even attempt to initiate a personal friend relationship, or find a friend in a place outside the school or workplace, would be extremely difficult.
PHILOSOPHER: Do you have anyone whom you would call a close friend?
YOUTH: I have a friend. But I'm not sure I'd call him a close friend . . .
PHILOSOPHER: It used to be the same for me. When I was in high school, I did not even try to make friends and spent my days studying Greek and German, quietly absorbed in reading philosophy books. My mother was worried about me and went to consult my homeroom teacher. And my teacher told her, "There's no need to worry. He's a person who doesn't need friends." Those words were very encouraging to my mother, and to me as well.
YOUTH: A person who doesn't need friends? So in high school you didn't have a single friend?
PHILOSOPHER: I did have one friend. He said, "There's nothing really worth learning at a university," and in the end he actually did not enter university. He went into seclusion up in the mountains for several years, and these days I hear he's working in journalism in Southeast Asia. I haven't seen him in decades, but I have the feeling that if we got together again, we'd be able to hang out just as we did back then. A lot of people think that the more friends you have the better, but I'm not so sure about that. There's no value at all in the number of friends or acquaintances you have. And this is a subject that connects with the task of love, but what we should be thinking about is the distance and depth of the relationship.
YOUTH: Will it be possible for me to make close friends?
PHILOSOPHER: Of course it will. If you change, those around you will change too. They will have no choice but to change. <em>Adlerian psychology is a psychology for changing oneself, not a psychology for changing others</em>. Instead of waiting for others to change or waiting for the situation to change, you take the first step forward yourself.
YOUTH: Hmm . . .
PHILOSOPHER: The fact is that you came like this to visit me in my room. And, in you, I have found a young friend.
YOUTH: I am your friend?
PHILOSOPHER: Yes, because you are. The dialogue going on here is not counseling, and we do not have a work relationship. To me, you are an irreplaceable friend. Don't you think so?
YOUTH: I'm your . . . irreplaceable friend? No, I won't think anything about that right now. Let's just keep going. What about the last one, the task of love?
PHILOSOPHER: Think of it as divided into two stages: one, what are known as love relationships; and two, relationships with family, in particular parent-child relationships. We have discussed work and friendship, but of the three tasks, most likely it is the task of love that is the most difficult. When a friend relationship has turned into love, speech and conduct that were permitted between friends may no longer be permitted the moment they become lovers. Specifically, that would mean not permitting socializing with friends of the opposite sex, and in some cases just speaking on the telephone to someone of the opposite sex is enough to arouse jealousy. The distance is that close, and the relationship that deep.
YOUTH: Yes, I suppose it can't be helped.
PHILOSOPHER: But Adler does not accept restricting one's partner. If the person seems to be happy, one can frankly celebrate that condition. That is love. Relationships in which people restrict each other eventually fall apart.
YOUTH: Wait, that's an argument that can only lead to affirming infidelity. Because if one's partner were happily having an affair, you're saying that one should celebrate even that.
PHILOSOPHER: No, I am not affirming someone having an affair. Think about it this way: The kind of relationship that feels somehow oppressive and strained when the two people are together cannot be called love, even if there is passion. When one can think, Whenever I am with this person, I can behave very freely, one can really feel love. One can be in a calm and quite natural state, without having feelings of inferiority or being beset with the need to flaunt one's superiority. That is what real love is like. Restriction, on the other hand, is a manifestation of the mind-set of attempting to control one's partner, and also an idea founded on a sense of distrust. Being in the same space with someone who distrusts you isn't a natural situation that one can put up with, is it? As Adler says, "If two people want to live together on good terms, they must treat each other as equal personalities."
YOUTH: Okay.
PHILOSOPHER: However, in love relationships and marital relationships, there is the option of separating. So even a husband and wife who have been together for many years can separate if continuing the relationship becomes distressful. In a parent-child relationship, however, in principle this cannot be done. If romantic love is a relationship connected by red string, then the relationship between parents and children is bound in rigid chains. And a pair of small scissors is all you have. This is the difficulty of the parent-child relationship.
YOUTH: So what can one do?
PHILOSOPHER: What I can say at this stage is: You must not run away. No matter how distressful the relationship, you must not avoid or put off dealing with it. Even if in the end you're going to cut it with scissors, first you have to face it. The worst thing to do is to just stand still with the situation as it is. It is fundamentally impossible for a person to live life completely alone, and it is only in social contexts that the person becomes an "individual." That is why in Adlerian psychology, self-reliance as an individual and cooperation within society are put forth as overarching objectives. Then, how can one achieve these objectives? On this point, Adler speaks of surmounting the three tasks of work, friendship, and love, the tasks of the interpersonal relationships that a living person has no choice but to confront.
NARRATOR: The youth was still struggling to grasp their true meaning.
