HEADER3: Admitting Fault Is Not Defeat
YOUTH: All right, then what should you do when you're subjected to personal attacks right to your face? Do you just grin and bear it?
PHILOSOPHER: No, the idea that you are "bearing it" is proof that you are still stuck in the power struggle. When you are challenged to a fight, and you sense that it is a power struggle, step down from the conflict as soon as possible. Do not answer his action with a reaction. That is the only thing we can do.
YOUTH: But is it really that easy to not respond to provocation? In the first place, how would you say I should control my anger?
PHILOSOPHER: When you control your anger, you're "bearing it," right? Instead, let's learn a way to settle things without using the emotion of anger. Because after all, anger is a tool. A means for achieving a goal.
YOUTH: That's a tough one.
PHILOSOPHER: The first thing that I want you to understand here is the fact that anger is a form of communication, and that communication is nevertheless possible without using anger. We can convey our thoughts and intentions and be accepted without any need for anger. If you learn to understand this experientially, the anger emotion will stop appearing all on its own.
YOUTH: But what if they come at you with mistaken accusations, or make insulting comments? I shouldn't get angry even then?
PHILOSOPHER: You don't seem to understand yet. It's not that you mustn't get angry, but that there is no need to rely on the tool of anger. Irascible people do not have short tempers--it is only that they do not know that there are effective communication tools other than anger. That is why people end up saying things like "I just snapped" or, "He flew into a rage." We end up relying on anger to communicate.
YOUTH: Effective communication tools other than anger . . .
PHILOSOPHER: We have language. We can communicate through language. Believe in the power of language and the language of logic.
YOUTH: Certainly, if I did not believe in that, we wouldn't be having this dialogue.
PHILOSOPHER: One more thing about power struggles. In every instance, no matter how much you might think you are right, try not to criticize the other party on that basis. This is an interpersonal relationship trap that many people fall into.
YOUTH: Why's that?
PHILOSOPHER: The moment one is convinced that "I am right" in an interpersonal relationship, one has already stepped into a power struggle.
YOUTH: Just because you think you're right? No way, that's just blowing things all out of proportion.
PHILOSOPHER: I am right. That is to say, the other party is wrong. At that point, the focus of the discussion shifts from "the rightness of the assertions" to "the state of the interpersonal relationship." In other words, the conviction that "I am right" leads to the assumption that "this person is wrong," and finally it becomes a contest and you are thinking, I have to win. It's a power struggle through and through.
YOUTH: Hmm.
PHILOSOPHER: In the first place, the rightness of one's assertions has nothing to do with winning or losing. If you think you are right, regardless of what other people's opinions might be, the matter should be closed then and there. However, many people will rush into a power struggle and try to make others submit to them. And that is why they think of "admitting a mistake" as "admitting defeat."
YOUTH: Yes, there definitely is that aspect.
PHILOSOPHER: Because of one's mind-set of not wanting to lose, one is unable to admit one's mistake, the result being that one ends up choosing the wrong path. Admitting mistakes, conveying words of apology, and stepping down from power struggles--none of these things is defeat. The pursuit of superiority is not something that is carried out through competition with other people.
YOUTH: So when you're hung up on winning and losing, you lose the ability to make the right choices?
PHILOSOPHER: Yes. It clouds your judgment, and all you can see is imminent victory or defeat. Then you turn down the wrong path. It's only when we take away the lenses of competition and winning and losing that we can begin to correct and change ourselves.
