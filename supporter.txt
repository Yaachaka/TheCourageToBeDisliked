HEADER3: All Problems Are Interpersonal Relationship Problems
YOUTH: Wait a minute! I'm supposed to just let that one slip by? "To get rid of one's problems, all one can do is live in the universe all alone"? What do you mean by that? If you lived all alone, wouldn't you be horribly lonely?
PHILOSOPHER: Oh, but being alone isn't what makes you feel lonely. Loneliness is having other people and society and community around you, and having a deep sense of being excluded from them. To feel lonely, we need other people. That is to say, it is only in social contexts that a person becomes an "individual."
YOUTH: If you were really alone, that is, if you existed completely alone in the universe, you wouldn't be an individual and you wouldn't feel lonely, either?
PHILOSOPHER: I suppose the very concept of loneliness wouldn't even come up. You wouldn't need language, and there'd be no use for logic or common sense, either. But such a thing is impossible. Even if you lived on an uninhabited island, you would think about someone far across the ocean. Even if you spend your nights alone, you strain your ears to hear the sound of someone's breath. As long as there is someone out there somewhere, you will be haunted by loneliness.
YOUTH: But then you could just rephrase that as, "If one could live in the universe all alone, one's problems would go away," couldn't you?
PHILOSOPHER: In theory, yes. As Adler goes so far as to assert, <b>"All problems are interpersonal relationship problems."</b>
YOUTH: Can you say that again?
PHILOSOPHER: We can repeat it as many times as you like: All problems are interpersonal relationship problems. This is a concept that runs to the very root of Adlerian psychology. If all interpersonal relationships were gone from this world, which is to say if one were alone in the universe and all other people were gone, all manner of problems would disappear.
YOUTH: That's a lie! It's nothing more than academic sophistry.
PHILOSOPHER: Of course, we cannot do without interpersonal relationships. A human being's existence, in its very essence, assumes the existence of other human beings. Living completely separate from others is, in principle, impossible. As you are indicating, the premise "If one could live all alone in the universe" is unsound.
YOUTH: That's not the issue I am talking about. Sure, interpersonal relationships are probably a big problem. That much I acknowledge. But to say that everything comes down to interpersonal relationship problems, now that's really an extreme position. What about the worry of being cut off from interpersonal relationships, the kind of problems that an individual agonizes over as an individual, problems directed to oneself? Do you deny all that?
PHILOSOPHER: <b>There is no such thing as worry that is completely defined by the individual; so-called internal worry does not exist. Whatever the worry that may arise, the shadows of other people are always present.</b>
YOUTH: But still, you're a philosopher. Human beings have loftier, greater problems than things like interpersonal relationships. What is happiness? What is freedom? And what is the meaning of life? Aren't these the themes that philosophers have been investigating ever since the ancient Greeks? And you're saying, So what? Interpersonal relationships are everything? It seems kind of pedestrian to me. It's hard to believe that a philosopher would say such things.
PHILOSOPHER: Well, then, it seems there's a need to explain things a bit more concretely.
YOUTH: Yes, please do! If you're going to tell me that you're a philosopher, then you've got to really explain things, or else this makes no sense.
PHILOSOPHER: You were so afraid of interpersonal relationships that you came to dislike yourself. You've avoided interpersonal relationships by disliking yourself. 
NARRATOR: These assertions shook the youth to his very core. The words had an undeniable truth that seemed to pierce his heart. Even so, he had to find a clear rebuttal to the statement that all the problems that people experience are interpersonal relationship problems. Adler was trivializing people's issues. The problems I'm suffering from aren't so mundane!
