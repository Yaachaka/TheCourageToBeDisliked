HEADER3: From the Psychology of Possession to the Psychology of Practice
YOUTH: So in the end what you're talking about is courage? That reminds me, last time you said that Adlerian psychology is a "psychology of courage."
PHILOSOPHER: I will add to that by saying that Adlerian psychology is not a "psychology of possession" but a "psychology of use."
YOUTH: So it's that statement: "It's not what one is born with but what use one makes of that equipment."
PHILOSOPHER: That's right. Thank you for remembering it. Freudian etiology is a psychology of possession, and eventually it arrives at determinism. Adlerian psychology, on the other hand, is a psychology of use, and it is you who decides it.
YOUTH: Adlerian psychology is a psychology of courage, and at the same time it is a psychology of use . . .
PHILOSOPHER: We humans are not so fragile as to simply be at the mercy of etiological (cause and effect) traumas. From the standpoint of teleology, we choose our lives and our lifestyles ourselves. We have the power to do that.
YOUTH: But, honestly, I do not have the confidence to overcome my inferiority complex. And you might say that that's a life-lie, but I probably won't ever be able to break free from the inferiority complex.
PHILOSOPHER: Why don't you think so?
YOUTH: Maybe what you are saying is right. Actually, I'm sure it is, and courage really is what I am lacking. I can accept the life-lie as well. I am scared of interacting with people. I don't want to get hurt in interpersonal relationships, and I want to put off my life tasks. That's why I have all these excuses ready. Yes, it's exactly as you say. But isn't what you are talking about a kind of spiritualism? All you're really saying is, "You've lost your courage, you've got to pluck up your courage." It's no different from the silly instructor who thinks he's giving you advice when he comes up and slaps you on the shoulder and says, "Cheer up." Even though the reason I'm not doing well is because I can't just cheer up!
PHILOSOPHER: So what you are saying is that you would like me to suggest some specific steps?
YOUTH: Yes, please. I am a human being. I am not a machine. I've been told that I'm all out of courage, but I can't just get a refill of courage as if I were filling up my tank with fuel.
PHILOSOPHER: All right. But we've gone quite late again tonight, so let's continue this next time.
YOUTH: You aren't running away from it, right?
PHILOSOPHER: Of course not. Next time, we will probably discuss freedom.
YOUTH: Not courage?
PHILOSOPHER: Yes, it will be a discussion of freedom, which is essential when talking about courage. Please give some thought to the matter of what freedom is.
YOUTH: What freedom is . . . Fine. I am looking forward to next time.
