HEADER3: Socrates and Adler
YOUTH: All right. Let me tell you about another friend of mine, a man named Y. He's the kind of person who has always had a bright personality and talks easily to anyone. He's like a sunflower—everyone loves him, and people smile whenever he's around. In contrast, I am someone who has never had an easy time socially and who's kind of warped in various ways. Now, you are claiming that people can change through Adler's teleology?
PHILOSOPHER: Yes. You and I and everyone can change.
YOUTH: Then, do you think I could become someone like Y? From the bottom of my heart, I really wish I could be like him.
PHILOSOPHER: At this point, I'd have to say that's totally out of the question.
YOUTH: Aha! Now you're showing your true colors! So are you going to retract your theory?
PHILOSOPHER: No, I am not. Unfortunately, you have almost no understanding of Adlerian psychology yet. The first step to change is knowing.
YOUTH: So if I can understand just something about Adlerian psychology, can I become a person like Y?
PHILOSOPHER: Why are you rushing for answers? You should arrive at answers on your own, not rely upon what you get from someone else. Answers from others are nothing more than stopgap measures; they're of no value. Take Socrates, who left not one book actually written by himself. He spent his days having public debates with the citizens of Athens, especially the young, and it was his disciple, Plato, who put his philosophy into writing for future generations. Adler, too, showed little interest in literary activities, preferring to engage in personal dialogue at cafés in Vienna, and hold small discussion groups. He was definitely not an armchair intellectual.
YOUTH: So Socrates and Adler both conveyed their ideas by dialogue?
PHILOSOPHER: That's right. All your doubts will be dispelled through this dialogue. And you will begin to change. Not by my words, but by your own doing. I do not want to take away that valuable process of arriving at answers through dialogue.
YOUTH: So are we going to try and reenact the kind of dialogue that Socrates and Adler carried out? In this little study?
PHILOSOPHER: Isn't that good enough for you?
YOUTH: That's what I'm hoping to find out! So let's take it as far as we can, until either you retract your theory or I bow before you.
