HEADER3: An Inferiority Complex Is an Excuse
YOUTH: But can you say for sure that feelings of inferiority are really a problem of interpersonal relationships? Even the kind of person who is regarded socially as a success, who doesn't need to debase himself in relationships with other people, still has some feelings of inferiority? Even the businessman who amasses enormous wealth, the peerless beauty who is the envy of all, and the Olympic gold medalist--every one of them would be plagued by feelings of inferiority. Well, that's how it seems to me. How should I think about this?
PHILOSOPHER: Adler recognizes that feelings of inferiority are something everyone has. There's nothing bad about feelings of inferiority themselves.
YOUTH: So why do people have them in the first place?
PHILOSOPHER: It's probably necessary to understand this in a certain order. First of all, people enter this world as helpless beings. And people have the universal desire to escape from that helpless state. Adler called this the "pursuit of superiority."
YOUTH: Pursuit of superiority?
PHILOSOPHER: This is something you could think of as simply "hoping to improve" or "pursuing an ideal state." For instance, a toddler learns to steady himself on both legs. He has the universal desire to learn language and to improve. And all the advancements of science throughout human history are due to this "pursuit of superiority," too.
YOUTH: Okay. And then?
PHILOSOPHER: The counterpart of this is the feeling of inferiority. Everyone is in this "condition of wanting to improve" that is the pursuit of superiority. One holds up various ideals or goals and heads toward them. However, on not being able to reach one's ideals, one harbors a sense of being lesser. For instance, there are chefs who, the more inspired and accomplished they become, are forever beset with the sort of feeling of inferiority that makes them say to themselves, I'm still not good enough, or I've got to bring my cooking to the next level, and that sort of thing.
YOUTH: That's true.
PHILOSOPHER: Adler is saying that the pursuit of superiority and the feeling of inferiority are not diseases but stimulants to normal, healthy striving and growth. If it is not used in the wrong way, the feeling of inferiority, too, can promote striving and growth.
YOUTH: The feeling of inferiority is a kind of launch pad?
PHILOSOPHER: That's right. One tries to get rid of one's feeling of inferiority and keep moving forward. One's never satisfied with one's present situation--even if it's just a single step, one wants to make progress. One wants to be happier. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the state of this kind of feeling of inferiority. There are, however, people who lose the courage to take a single step forward, who cannot accept the fact that the situation can be changed by making realistic efforts. People who, before even doing anything, simply give up and say things like "I'm not good enough anyway" or "Even if I tried, I wouldn't stand a chance."
YOUTH: Well, that's true. There's no doubt about it--if the feeling of inferiority is strong, most people will become negative and say, "I'm not good enough anyway." Because that's what a feeling of inferiority is.
PHILOSOPHER: No, that's not a feeling of inferiority--that's an inferiority complex.
YOUTH: A complex? That's what the feeling of inferiority is, isn't it?
PHILOSOPHER: Be careful. The way the word "complex" is used today, it seems to have the same meaning as "feeling of inferiority." You hear people saying, "I've got a complex about my eyelids," or "He's got a complex about his education," that sort of thing. This is an utter misuse of the term. At base, "complex" refers to an abnormal mental state made up of a complicated group of emotions and ideas, and has nothing to do with the feeling of inferiority. For instance, there's Freud's Oedipus complex, which is used in the context of discussing the abnormal attraction of the child to the opposite-sex parent.
YOUTH: Yes. The nuances of abnormality are especially strong when it comes to the mother complex and the father complex.
PHILOSOPHER: For the same reason, then, it's crucial to not mix up "feeling of inferiority" and "inferiority complex," and to think about them as clearly separate.
YOUTH: Concretely, how are they different?
PHILOSOPHER: There is nothing particularly wrong with the feeling of inferiority itself. You understand this point now, right? As Adler says, the feeling of inferiority can be a trigger for striving and growth. For instance, if one had a feeling of inferiority with regard to one's education, and resolved to oneself, I'm not well educated, so I'll just have to try harder than anyone else, that would be a desirable direction. The inferiority complex, on the other hand, refers to a condition of having begun to use one's feeling of inferiority as a kind of excuse. So one thinks to oneself, I'm not well educated, so I can't succeed, or I'm not good-looking, so I can't get married. When someone is insisting on the logic of "A is the situation, so B cannot be done" in such a way in everyday life, that is not something that fits in the feeling of inferiority category. It is an inferiority complex.
YOUTH: No, it's a legitimate causal relationship. If you're not well educated, it takes away your chances of getting work or making it in the world. You're regarded as low on the social scale, and you can't succeed. That's not an excuse at all. It's just a cold hard fact, isn't it?
PHILOSOPHER: No, you are wrong.
YOUTH: How? Where am I wrong?
PHILOSOPHER: What you are calling a causal relationship is something that Adler explains as "apparent cause and effect." That is to say, you convince yourself that there is some serious causal relationship where there is none whatsoever. The other day, someone told me, "The reason I can't get married easily is that my parents got divorced when I was a child." From the viewpoint of Freudian etiology (the attributing of causes), the parents' divorce was a great trauma, which connects in a clear causal relationship with one's views on marriage. Adler, however, with his stance of teleology (the attributing of purpose), rejects such arguments as "apparent cause and effect."
YOUTH: But even so, the reality is that having a good education makes it easier to be successful in society. I had thought you were wise to the ways of the world.
PHILOSOPHER: The real issue is how one confronts that reality. If what you are thinking is, I'm not well educated, so I can't succeed, then instead of I can't succeed, you should think, I don't want to succeed.
YOUTH: I don't want to succeed? What kind of reasoning is that?
PHILOSOPHER: It's simply that it's scary to take even one step forward; also, that you don't want to make realistic efforts. You don't want to change so much that you'd be willing to sacrifice the pleasures you enjoy now--for instance, the time you spend playing and engaged in hobbies. In other words, you're not equipped with the courage to change your lifestyle. It's easier with things just as they are now, even if you have some complaints or limitations.
