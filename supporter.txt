HEADER3: How to Rid Yourself of Interpersonal Relationship Problems
YOUTH: I don't know, it just doesn't sit right with me.
PHILOSOPHER: Then let's envision a scene in which your parents are vehemently opposing your choice of place of employment. They were in fact against it, weren't they?
YOUTH: Yes, they were. I wouldn't go so far as saying they were vehemently opposed, but they did make various snide remarks.
PHILOSOPHER: Well, let's exaggerate it and say they were vehemently opposed. Your father was ranting and raving with emotion, and your mother was protesting your decision with tears in her eyes. They absolutely do not approve of you becoming a librarian, and if you will not take on the family business like your brother has, they may very well disown you. But how to come to terms with the emotion of "not approving" is your parents' task, not yours. It is not a problem for you to worry about.
YOUTH: Now wait a minute. Are you saying that it doesn't matter how sad I make my parents feel?
PHILOSOPHER: That's right. It doesn't matter.
YOUTH: You've got to be joking! Could there be such a thing as a philosophy that recommends unfilial behavior?
PHILOSOPHER: All you can do with regard to your own life is choose the best path that you believe in. On the other hand, what kind of judgment do other people pass on that choice? That is the task of other people, and is not a matter you can do anything about.
YOUTH: What another person thinks of you--if he or she likes you or dislikes you--that is that person's task, not mine. Is that what you are saying?
PHILOSOPHER: That is what separating is. You are worried about other people looking at you. You are worried about being judged by other people. That is why you are constantly craving recognition from others. Now, why are you worried about other people looking at you, anyway? Adlerian psychology has an easy answer. You haven't done the separation of tasks yet. You assume that even things that should be other people's tasks are your own. Remember the words of the grandmother: "You're the only one who's worried how you look." Her remark drives right to the heart of the separation of tasks. What other people think when they see your face--that is the task of other people and is not something you have any control over.
YOUTH: As theory, I get it. To my reasoning brain, it does make sense. But my emotions can't keep up with such a high-handed argument.
PHILOSOPHER: Then let's try another tack. Say there's a man who's distressed about the interpersonal relationships at the company where he works. He has a completely irrational boss who yells at him at every opportunity. No matter how hard he tries, his boss doesn't acknowledge his efforts and never even really listens to what he says.
YOUTH: That sounds exactly like my boss.
PHILOSOPHER: But is being acknowledged by your boss "work" that you should think of as top priority? It isn't your job to be liked by people at the place you work. Your boss doesn't like you. And his reasons for not liking you are clearly unreasonable. But in that case, there's no need for you to get cozy with him.
YOUTH: That sounds right, but the person is my boss, right? I won't get any work done if I'm shunned by my direct superior.
PHILOSOPHER: That is Adler's life-lie again. I can't do my work because I've been shunned by my boss. It's the boss's fault that my work isn't going well. The person who says such things is bringing up the existence of the boss as an excuse for the work that doesn't go well. Much like the female student with the fear of blushing, it's actually that you need the existence of an awful boss. Because then you can say, "If only I didn't have this boss, I could get more work done."
YOUTH: No, you don't know my relationship with my boss! I wish you would stop making arbitrary guesses.
PHILOSOPHER: This is a discussion that is concerned with the fundamentals of Adlerian psychology. If you are angry, nothing will sink in. You think, I've got that boss, so I can't work. This is complete etiology. But it's really, I don't want to work, so I'll create an awful boss, or I don't want to acknowledge my incapable self, so I'll create an awful boss. That would be the teleological way of looking at it.
YOUTH: That's probably how it'd be framed in your stock teleology approach. But in my case, it's different.
PHILOSOPHER: Then suppose you had done the separation of tasks. How would things be? In other words, no matter how much your boss tries to vent his unreasonable anger at you, that is not your task. The unreasonable emotions are tasks for your boss to deal with himself. There is no need to cozy up to him, or to yield to him to the point of bowing down. You should think, What I should do is face my own tasks in my own life without lying.
YOUTH: But that's . . .
PHILOSOPHER: We are all suffering in interpersonal relationships. It might be the relationship with one's parents or one's elder brother, and it might be the interpersonal relationships at one's workplace. Now, last time, you were saying that you wanted some specific steps. This is what I propose. First, one should ask, "Whose task is this?" Then do the separation of tasks. Calmly delineate up to what point one's own tasks go, and from what point they become another person's tasks. And do not intervene in other people's tasks, or allow even a single person to intervene in one's own tasks. This is a specific and revolutionary viewpoint that is unique to Adlerian psychology and contains the potential to utterly change one's interpersonal relationship problems.
YOUTH: Aha. I am starting to see what you meant when you said that the topic of today's discussion was freedom.
PHILOSOPHER: That's right. We are trying to talk about freedom now.
