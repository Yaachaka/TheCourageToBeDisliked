HEADER3: Two Paths Traveled by Those Wanting to Be "Special Beings"
YOUTH: You still have not answered my question. Maybe I could actually learn to like myself through contribution to others. Maybe I could come to feel that I have worth, that I am not a worthless being. But is that all a person needs to be happy? Having come into this world, I think that unless I am able to accomplish the sort of grand undertaking that future generations will remember me for, unless I can prove myself as "I, who am no one else but me," I will never find true happiness. You are trying to frame everything within interpersonal relations without saying a thing about self-realizing happiness. If you ask me, that's nothing but evasion!
PHILOSOPHER: I'm not really sure what you mean by "self-realizing happiness." What exactly are you referring to?
YOUTH: It's something that is different for each person. I suppose there are those who want to succeed in society and those who have more personal objectives--a researcher endeavoring to develop a wonder drug, for instance, or an artist who strives to create a satisfying body of work.
PHILOSOPHER: What is it for you?
YOUTH: I still don't really know what I am looking for or what I'll want to do in the future. But I know that I've got to do something. There's no way I'm going to spend the rest of my days working in a university library. When I find a dream that I can devote my life to, and I attain self-realization, that's when I'll experience true happiness. My father was someone who buried himself in his work from day to night, and I have no idea if that was happiness to him or not. To my eyes, at least, he seemed forever busy and never happy. That is not the kind of life I want to lead.
PHILOSOPHER: All right. If you think about this point using children who engage in problem behavior as an example, it might be easier to grasp.
YOUTH: Problem behavior?
PHILOSOPHER: That's right. First of all, we human beings have a universal desire that is referred to as "pursuit of superiority." Do you recall our discussion of this?
YOUTH: Yes. Simply put, it's a term that indicates "hoping to improve" and "pursuing an ideal state."
PHILOSOPHER: There are many children who, in their early stages, try to be especially good. In particular, they obey their parents, comport themselves in a socially acceptable manner, apply themselves assiduously to their studies and in sports, and excel in extracurricular activities as well. In this way, they try to get their parents to acknowledge them. However, when being especially good does not work out--their studies or sports don't go well, for example--they do an about-face and try to be especially bad.
YOUTH: Why do they do that?
PHILOSOPHER: Whether they are trying to be especially good, or trying to be especially bad, the goal is the same: to attract the attention of other people, get out of the "normal" condition and become a "special being." That is their only goal.
YOUTH: Hmm. All right, please go on.
PHILOSOPHER: In any case, whether it is one's studies or one's participation in sports, either way one needs to make a constant effort if one is to produce any kind of significant results. But the children who try to be especially bad--that is to say, the ones who engage in problem behavior--are endeavoring to attract the attention of other people even as they continue to avoid any such healthy effort. In Adlerian psychology, this is referred to as the "pursuit of easy superiority." Take, for example, the problem child who disrupts lessons by throwing erasers or speaking in a loud voice. He is certain to get the attention of his friends and teachers. Even if it is something that is limited to that place, he will probably succeed in becoming a special being. But that is a pursuit of easy superiority, and it is an unhealthy attitude.
YOUTH: So children who commit delinquent acts are engaging in the pursuit of easy superiority, too?
PHILOSOPHER: Yes, they are. All types of problem behavior, from refusing to attend school, to wrist cutting, to underage drinking and smoking, and so on, are forms of the pursuit of easy superiority. And your shut-in friend, whom you told me about at the beginning, is engaging in it, too. When a child engages in problem behavior, his parents and other adults rebuke him. Being rebuked, more than anything else, puts stress on the child. But even if it is in the form of rebuke, the child wants his parents' attention. He wants to be a special being, and the form that attention takes doesn't matter. So in a sense, it is only natural that he does not stop engaging in problem behavior, no matter how harshly he is rebuked.
YOUTH: It's because of their rebuking that he doesn't stop the problem behavior?
PHILOSOPHER: Exactly. Because the parents and other adults are giving him attention through the act of rebuking.
YOUTH: But previously, you spoke of the goal of problem behavior as being revenge on the parents, right? Does that connect with this in some way?
PHILOSOPHER: Yes. "Revenge" and "pursuit of easy superiority" are easily linked. One makes trouble for another person while trying at the same time to be "special."
